      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Activities Purpose
        The activities organized by the Institute provide the opportunity for fun in a healthy way, thus creating an environment where you can make and strengthen friendships, share experiences, have fun moments, demonstrate and appreciate other talents, serve and be served. As we learn from the scriptures, … Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. (2 Nephi 2:26). So these special moments that we have during activities is part of that joy which we can have in our mortal life.

        Past Activities
        These were some of our activities which we had on the institute. 
        Next Activities 
        These are our upcoming activities we will have on the institute, with the dates and locations, schedule in your agenda and don’t miss out.
